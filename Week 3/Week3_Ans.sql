-- 1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
select count(distinct customer_id) as count_customers
from subscriptions;

-- 2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value
select month(start_date) as Month, count(*) as distribution_values
from subscriptions
where plan_id = '0'
group by month(start_date)
order by Month;

-- 3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name
select plan_name, count(plan_name) as counts
from plans p join subscriptions s on p.plan_id = s.plan_id
where year(start_date) > 2020
group by plan_name;

-- 4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?
select count(distinct customer_id) as count,
       round(count(distinct customer_id) / (select count(distinct customer_id) from subscriptions) * 100, 1) as percentage
from subscriptions
where plan_id = '4'
group by plan_id;

-- 5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?
with cte_plan as (select customer_id, group_concat(distinct plan_id) as plan
                  from subscriptions
                  group by customer_id)
select  count(*), 
        round((count(*) / (select count(distinct customer_id) from subscriptions) * 100), 0) as percentage
from cte_plan
where plan like '%0,4%';

-- 6. What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?
with cte_next_plan as (select customer_id, p.plan_id, LEAD(p.plan_name) OVER(PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY p.plan_id) AS next_plan
                       from subscriptions s JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
                       where customer_id in (select customer_id from subscriptions where plan_id = '0'))
select  next_plan, 
        count(c.plan_id) as count_plan,
        round((count(c.plan_id) / (select count(distinct customer_id) from subscriptions) * 100), 1) as percentage
from cte_next_plan c join plans p on c.plan_id = p.plan_id

-- The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:
--      monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
--      upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
--      upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
--      once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

--                                                                          D. Outside The Box Questions

-- 3. What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?
-- 4. If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the survey?
-- 5. What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?
